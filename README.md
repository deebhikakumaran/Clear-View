> Empowering communities to report, visualize, and act on environmental pollution – starting with India’s invisible informal industry emissions.

---

## 🧠 Problem

Unseen pollution from informal industries across India continues to contaminate local ecosystems and communities. There’s a lack of **real-time, geotagged data** to take timely action or raise awareness.

---

## ✅ Our Solution: Clear View

**Clear View** is a mobile-first, community-powered web app that allows users to **report environmental pollution incidents**. The platform **geotags and visualizes** pollution data on an interactive public map. It supports **AI-assisted classification**, **NGO collaboration**, and **biodiversity hotspot tracking**.

---

## ⚡ Key Features (Hackathon MVP – Built in 24 Hours)

- 📸 **Simple Reporting Interface**: Submit pollution reports via a mobile-friendly form. Auto-captures geolocation. Supports image upload.
- 🗺️ **Geotagged Hotspot Map**: Displays reports on a real-time, interactive Leaflet map.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Image Classification**: Uses TensorFlow MobileNet to detect pollution in submitted photos.
- 🔍 **Filtering and Clustering**: Filter by pollution type, date range. Visual indicators for high-density zones.
